# Gruffalo
The text of the gruffalo captured in a python script.

NOTE:
The exercise was to capture the structure of the text so when the mouse encounters the gruffalo a loop was used even though it would have been more straight forward to just write those six lines of text out word for word.

## Lessons learned
- You cannot use escape characters in string literals used as inputs in f-strings (e.g. f"{'\t'} this won't work")
- There's a lot of minor variation in the Gruffalo I hadn't noticed before I did this (down to the punctuation)
